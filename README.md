# Project: Random Simple Imputer
 
-> This project demonstrates how to handle missing values using Random Imputation, where missing entries are replaced with randomly selected existing values from the same feature.
-> Itâ€™s applied separately to categorical and numerical data to preserve feature-level characteristics.

## Highlights:-
 
-> Random imputation for both numerical and categorical features
-> Ensures realistic value distribution
-> Implemented using Pandas and Scikit-learn
-> Comparison with traditional mean/median/mode imputation
-> Helps retain data variability and avoid over-smoothing
 
## Libraries Used:-
 
-> pandas
-> numpy
-> sklearn
-> matplotlib

## Goal:- 
 
-> To understand how random imputation works and why it can sometimes produce more realistic data than constant or average-based methods.
